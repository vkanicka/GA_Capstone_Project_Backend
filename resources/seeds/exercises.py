"We've all had situations that stir up judgment and critical thoughts about ourselves, leading to feelings of second-guessing or being self-critical. <strong>When you're feeling depressed, your ability to be resilient to these self-doubts is compromised even further</strong>, leading to extreme self-attacks that activate shame and self-loathing. Self compassion exercises like this one are essential in strengthening your ability to tolerate these judgmental blows, bringing you more understanding and compassion and decreasing shame. This exercise can be used anytime you notice moments of stess, negativity or discomfort.<br/><br/>'To start, think of an event that's activated a negative thought or judgment about yourself. Notice if you can feel that distress it causes in your body. Then follow these steps: <br/><br/><ol><li>Say in your mind:<em>I feel compassion for my pain.</em></li><li>Say in your mind:<em>I have all I need within me to face this.</em></li><li>Say in your mind:<em>I accept all feelings, the good and the bad.</em></li><li>Imagine sending compassion from your heart to all the parts of your body that hold tension.</li><br/><br/>Notice what happens to the tension and self judgmental thoughts. Write down any thoughts or feelings that arose or changed during the exercise."
